description: In April 1907 Jack London set out to sail around the world in the 45-foot
  ship The Snark, accompanied by his wife and a small crew. Although suffering from
  seasickness and tropical disease, London wrote prolifically, including a series
  of entertaining sketches of the voyage itself. These were later collected as The
  Cruise of the Snark, a remarkable record of adventure and love among the islands
  of the South Pacific. - Publisher.
